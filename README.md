Hi! Im Nick Der Ecte, aka Nick Designs. aka Nick Figner, a switzerland-based designer, coder and musician.


![NOVA inc.](https://github.com/NickDerEchte/NickDerEchte/blob/b98c083f3b8dae8366ecc06fca2f72c098dc9dee/novainc.png)

So, I'm working on that Project called NOVA inc. NOVA inc. is like a big, warm hug for creatives everywhere. With its cool offshoots, NOVA Creative inc. and NOVA Records inc., this company is all about lifting artists up and making their lives easier. Think of them as a backstage pass to creativity, where they're always ready to help you hit the right notes and find your groove. And if you ever feel like you're stuck in a creative rut, don't worry â€” NOVAâ€™s got your back!<br><br>

Well, Music is one of the most important things in my life. I listen to it very often but I also make it. <br>
